  # Something used for longer conversation.
  # Flows that the bot CAN follow.
  # It is actually the dialogue training data that allows Rasa to predict the next best action to take.
  # Story paths are also useful to define which entities are extracted from the same intent.

  # Or if neither one is possible, Rasa will use a fallback action.
